Hello everyone, my name is Stefan Seitz and currently i am a student at the "Technsische Hochschule NÃ¼rnberg" Germany and currently stuying electronics and informatics engineering.
My focus lays on automatisation, robotics and AI.
I am member of the AutonOhm student robotic team on my university.

This github will mainly contain code of old programms i did in various programming languages.
Those programs are mostly some random ideas i had and usally do not have any connection.

If you want to reach me, then do it by stefanseitz685@gmail.com
